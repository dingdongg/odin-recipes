# odin-recipes
This project was designed as part of the TOP curriculum. This project is called the Recipes project.

So far, I have learned about the basics of Git. More specifically, I have learned:
- how to create a repository on GitHub
- how to clone the repo on to my local machine 
- how to add modified files to the staging area
- how to commit the modified files with messages
- how to upload these commits back onto my GitHub repository
- how to see the history of my git commits

I have also delved into the basics of HTML. So far I have learned:
- about the HTML boilerplate
- about paragraph elements
- about anchor elements
- image elements
- header elements
- lists (ordered, unordered)
- about how the head element contains metadata about the website 
- about how the body element contains all of the information to be displayed on the website 

There are topics that I have touched on, but am still not familiar with/or have a hard time understanding.
My hope is that I visit these topcis in the future frequently to get a grasp of them.
- How the internet works 
- SETTING up git (SSH keys. I ran into a lot of issues pertaining to permission issues?)

By the end of this project, I will have solified my knowledge and understanding of the following topics:
