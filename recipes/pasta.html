        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>This dish is straight heat. Chicken breast marinated in soy sauce
            doesn't sound so pleasing on paper, but life isn't all papers.
            What would be just dry chicken breast is mediated by the soy sauce
            and texture is added with veggies :D issa must try !!!
